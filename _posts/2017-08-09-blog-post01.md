OpenSLAM
--------------

This project is a self-study project on [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) by Raul Mur-Artal. It is a real-time SLAM system for **Monocluar, Stereo and RGBD** cameras that computes the camera trajectory and a sparse 3D reconstruction. It is able to detect loop and relocalize the camera in real time. To see the details of the origin work, please refere to the following publication:

[Monocular] Raúl Mur-Artal, J. M. M. Montiel and Juan D. Tardós. **ORB-SLAM: A Versatile and Accurate Monocular SLAM System.** IEEE Transactions on Robotics, vol. 31, no. 5, pp. 1147-1163, 2015. **(2015 IEEE Transactions on Robotics Best Paper Award)**. [PDF](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~raulmur/MurMontielTardosTRO15.pdf).

This project is mainly the result of my self-study on ORB-SLAM and I decided to repackage the author's source code by using my own code specification ROS C++ style and OpenCV. See [OpenSLAM](https://github.com/Haotian-Zhang/OpenSLAM).

## Prerequisites
I have written my codes in Ubuntu 16.0. Since it's an ongoing project so I may not ensure the pieces might work currenly. Please wait until the blogs updates.  

### C++11 or C++0x Compiler
We use the new thread and chrono functionalities of C++11.

### OpenCV
We use OpenCV to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. Required at leat 2.4.3. Tested with OpenCV 2.4.11 and OpenCV 3.2.

### Eigen3
Required by g2o (see below). Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. Required at least 3.1.0.

### DBoW2 and g2o
We use modified versions of the [DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2) library to perform place recognition and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library to perform non-linear optimizations. Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the Thirdparty folder.
