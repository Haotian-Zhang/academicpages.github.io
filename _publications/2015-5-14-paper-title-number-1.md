excerpt: 'Graphene has been proved to be one of the promising candidate materials for high-frequency applications. The multilayer graphene ribbon (GR) based resonators are proposed and characterized in this work. The geometry- dependent resonant frequencies (f0) and unloaded Q-factors (Qu) 
of the GR-based resonators are investigated with the equivalent single conductor (ESC) model. It is found that by intercalation doping with AsF5, the graphene resonators can provide a high Qu 
of 80.6 at f0=793.1 GHz, superior to the copper and neutral 
graphene based ones. '
